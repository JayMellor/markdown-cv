## Professional Experience

`2021-present`
**EY** Senior Full Stack Developer

_Technologies used: All specified technologies in Technical Skills_

Maintainer and Subject Matter Expert of the Business Influencer Platform (BIP), the name of the HR culture transformation platform following Tao Leadership's acquisition by EY.

- Set the standards on code quality and architecture in code repositories

- Optimised survey analytics pipeline using pandas and queryset aggregation bringing a 2 hour run down to 2 minutes while also making the code easier to manage and test. This allowed greater confidence in the system to produce data-driven insights at scale

- Optimised the key network graph visualisation on the platform by using hash maps and adjacency lists, allowing a 50,000 node graph to be rendered and re-rendered in under a second, where it timed out previously. This allowed for the connections of a large company to be displayed in granular detail on a web browser

`2019-2021`
**Tao Leadership Ltd** Full Stack Developer

_Technologies used: All specified technologies in Technical Skills_

Tao Leadership Ltd was a small (7-8 people)  HR consultancy that used Data Science insights from survey results to drive culture change. It was acquired by EY in 2021. 

- Part of a small development team (2-3 people)

- Role covered entire development cycle, including:
	- Collecting requirements from the stakeholder
	- Designing UI mockups
	- Implementing
	- Testing
	- Deployment to demo and production environments
	- Training the client on functionality
	- Managing client queries and bug reports
	
- Able to quickly pivot implementations and projects according to quickly changing requirements from the stakeholder. We worked in a cadence of 1-week sprints to handle the everchanging workload
	
- Rearchitected existing survey system by removing redundant Django models and Celery tasks and consolidating functionality into a smaller core. This allows for simpler operational maintainance of daily surveys (a key product) while increasing code readability and test coverage

- Built communication data analysis tool with Django (in part using TDD) to query a Microsoft Graph endpoint and store its consolidated results on a client's cloud instance. This allowed for consensual retrieval of client metadata to provide a more accurate picture of their interactions as used in culture change

- Developed a D&I dashboard in Angular for a client to learn their company's segregations and prejudices resulting from anonymously and consensually collected data. This makes use of data manipulation on both the frontend and backend to display data in an intuitive manner having been produced by an AWS Lambda pipeline

- Trained clients on culture transformation platform for their role in guiding their leaders in culture change. This allows for increased product knowledge by the client, in turn reducing misunderstanding and data errors

- Led the effort to increase test coverage and move to behaviour-driven unit testing, making the application more reliable and understandable

- Developed a sophisticated role-based permissions system ensuring users could only view and manage data they were authorised to. This allowed greater autonomy in user management, clearer boundaries for different user roles and ensuring the system could remain multi-tenanted.

- Implemented a data uploader, allowing user and demographic data, and later survey answers from 3rd party systems, to be uploaded en masse into the system in a reliable way, flagging errors or warnings when they occured. This allowed scalable support of clients engagements and insurance of their data's validity on the system.

`2016-2019`
**Kerridge Commercial Systems** Software Engineer

_Technologies used: KCML, CVS, Oracle, SSH_

Maintained a desktop ERP application written in proprietary KCML (simlar to C++) which queries an Oracle database. The application is hosted on client or third-party servers.

- Optimised client ERP operations by systematically allocating relevant products to a picker in a warehouse through use of precise SQL queries and providing simple design and UX. This increased the client's visibility and efficiency of warehouse throughput

- Enabled client visibility and insight on project expenses by allowing Purchase Orders to be allocated to a project, adding restrictions on the Purchase Orders relating to the budget of the project and providing a dashboard for the management of projects

- Mentored and trained the development team through sharing product and programming knowledge, pair-programming and hosting confidential one-to-one meetings. This allowed for greater knowledge transfer and increased psychological safety in the team
